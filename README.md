ANALYZE CAMERA DATA FROM A PLENOPTIC CAMERA
===========================================

One of my research works while being at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences.

Analyze the depth data from a plenoptic (light field) camera and try out different algorithms to perform 3D reconstruction.

Uses C++, Point Cloud Library, OpenCV, boost.
